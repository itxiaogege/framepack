# FramePack - Revolutionary AI Video Generator

## Project Overview
FramePack is an advanced AI video generation tool that uses "frame packing" technology to transform text descriptions and images into high-quality video content. Powered by a 13B parameter model, it can generate smooth, coherent video sequences.

## Technical Features
- **Frame Packing Technology**: Uses a special neural network structure to compress the context information of generated frames to a fixed length
- **Constant Workload**: Regardless of video length, the complexity of generating each frame remains constant
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Only 6GB VRAM needed to generate videos up to one minute long
- **Large-Scale Model**: Employs a 13B parameter model for precise rendering

## Core Functions
1. **Text to Video**: Convert text descriptions into smooth videos
2. **Scene Generation**: Create complex scenes and environments with AI
3. **Audio Integration**: Seamlessly match visuals with audio content
4. **Custom Styling**: Advanced customization options to adjust video style

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- CUDA
- Only requires 6GB VRAM
- 13B parameter model

## Installation and Usage
### Windows Installation
1. Download the one-click installer (CUDA 12.6 + PyTorch 2.6)
2. Extract the downloaded file
3. Run `update.bat` to get the latest version
4. Run `run.bat` to start the application

### Linux Installation
Recommended to use a separate Python 3.10 environment:
```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch GUI
python demo_gradio.py
```

## Prompt Writing Guide
Quality prompts are key to generating high-quality videos. Suggested structure:
```
[Subject] [Action Description] [Action Details], [Environment/Background Description]
```

### Prompt Examples
- "The girl dances gracefully, with clear movements, full of charm."
- "The man dances powerfully, striking sharp poses and gliding smoothly across the reflective floor."
- "The woman dances elegantly among the blossoms, spinning slowly with flowing sleeves and graceful hand movements."

## Parameter Optimization
| Parameter | Recommended Value | Description |
|------|--------|------|
| Sampling Steps | 25-50 | Higher steps = better quality, but slower speed |
| TeaCache | Enable during development | 30% faster, but may slightly impact quality |
| Seed | Random or fixed | Fixed seed allows result reproducibility |
| CFG Scale | 7-9 | Controls prompt influence strength |
| Video Length | 5-60 seconds | Shorter videos typically maintain better coherence |
